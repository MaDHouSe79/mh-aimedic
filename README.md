## QBCore AI Medic
This is a very cool AI-Medic mod specially made for [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core) servers, 
just in case there are little to no medical staff online and or the server is busy.

Here is the [mh-aiems](https://github.com/MaDHouSe79/mh-aiems) link

## Notes
- This is my first release so please be kind :)
- The amount to charge clients can be changed in Config.lua
- if you want to use the inlaststand check, Add this to the if statement in client.lua on line 85: `or PlayerData.metadata['inlaststand']`
